##anagrams

it solves anagrams. it's pretty simple. 
this program, wirtten in julia, was my afternoon project that i decided to make when my sister was asking me what the answer to her game could be. being the kind person i am, i decided to help her cheat. 

i think it's pretty efficient, but there's definitely a better way of doing this which would work with less compute power. that shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to run this on a windows me machine, though.
